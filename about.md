I'm a Web Designer and Front End Developer from Houston, Texas.

I currently work in IT Support and enjoy creating the right solution for my clients while providing great customer service.

When I'm not coding I enjoy spending time with my family, learning, reading sci-fi and fantasy books or watching a good movie or TV series.
