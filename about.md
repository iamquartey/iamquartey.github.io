I am an IT Consultant and Support Professional from Houston, Texas.

I enjoy learning how different types of technology work.  I learn best through hands-on experiences, such as observation, disassembly, and the reassembly of technology.  Some people have called me a tinkerer, but I do not mind.

I enjoy creating the right solution for my clients while providing excellent customer service.

When I am not troubleshooting issues or planning deployments, I enjoy spending time with my family, learning about GNU/Linux, watching robotics competitions, reading books, and watching a good movie or TV series.  I am not a long-form writer, so anything posted will be brief.
