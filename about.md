I'm a Web Developer from Houston, Texas.

I currently work in IT Support and enjoy creating the right solution for my clients while providing great customer service.

When I'm not coding I enjoy spending time with my family, learning about GNU/Linux, watching robotics competitions of all kinds, reading sci-fi and fantasy books or watching a good movie or TV series.  I am not much of a writer, so expect most posts to be short.

I had a different domain that was going to be used to document the building and programming process of a Parallax ActivityBot.  All of the things will be posted here from now on.
