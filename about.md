I am a Web Developer and IT Support Professional from Houston, Texas.

I enjoy learning how different types of technology work.  How I learn best is through hands on experience, such as observation, disassembly, and the reassembly of technology.  Some people have called me a tinkerer, but I do not mind.

I currently work in IT Support and enjoy creating the right solution for my clients while providing excellent customer service.

When I am not coding I enjoy spending time with my family, learning about GNU/Linux, watching robotics competitions, reading books, watching a good movie or TV series.  I am not much of a long form writer, so most posts will be short.
