### [Skillcrush Email Newsletter](http://www.adnanquartey.com/bonus101/) (HTML, CSS)
This page was a bonus assignment in a course I took in mid 2015.  We received a .psd file and were asked to recreate it as a webpage with HTML and CSS.  


*I was using a free Heroku account for Ruby on Rails deployments, but this is no longer an option. The sample projects were primarily Ruby on Rails demos that I adjusted in minor ways.  The projects are stored in my local git repo and have been removed from Heroku.  I have since stepped away from working on RoR projects.*

### [LinkDSG Supplies Rails 2-3 Update and UI Refresh - 2018-2019](https://supplies.linkdsg.com/) (Rails, Ruby, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
*This project has been replaced by another product since I worked on it.

I updated the project from Rails 2.x to Rails 3.x, correcting quite a few errors in the process and removing unused code paths.  I also worked with a web designer to integrate the newly approved layout into the legacy Rails app.
