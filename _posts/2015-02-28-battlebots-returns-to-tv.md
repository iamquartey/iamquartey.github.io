Remember the show BattleBots that aired during the early 2000's on Comedy Central? The show was based on a tournament of generally remote controlled fighting robots.

 Generally we got one versus one matches with robots in one of four weight classes Lightweight, Middleweight, Heavyweight and Superheavyweight. At the end of the tournaments there was a weight class rumble placing all robots that were still functional back in the Battlebox arena until there was only one functional machine remaining.

  The show was canceled after a few seasons, but now ABC plans to bring it back to primetime TV for six episodes during Summer 2015. The rules of the competition, show format and main focus of the show will be different, but as a robotics enthusiast I will be glued to the TV during the broadcasts.
