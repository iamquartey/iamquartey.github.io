Over the past year or so my focus has swayed towards coding/ building for the web.

So, I decided to take a few online courses with Skillcrush.  I am taking the Web Developer Blueprint which will cover HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby and Git.  I am excited, a refresher course in CSS will be NICE, the other topics will be mostly new to me.  The first class HTML/CSS opened up today so, I should be able to start working through the lessons.  Any projects or portfolio items will most likely end up on this site.
