I am currently hosting this site using WordPress on Amazon Web Services.  This is my first adventure into controlling a computer from the terminal/shell without a graphical user interface.

The AWS getting started guides are great, but I may have missed a few steps. All of that to say we experienced technical difficulties with my the web server and the site was down Thursday, Friday and part of Saturday.

Last weeks outage was just another chance to learn and prepare for the future.  While having the site go down was frustrating it also taught me a few things about self hosting and site monitoring.  I am enjoying wearing many hats for this experimental web site so much to learn.

-Cheers
