A package that I was expecting to receive in about four to six days from now arrived today.

Unfortunately, I was not able to spend any time looking over the contents of the box.  I did confirm the contents of the box as the Parallax Inc Activitybot Kit, which is great.  I am looking forward to learning about circuits and sensors with the Parallax Kit.

There will be images and maybe video up eventually.
