If you are wondering what happened to my ActivityBot Project, I have an answer for you.

It is still in the box, the ActivityBot has been assembled, but I did not install the software needed to write programs for the propeller activity board.  Yep, this project has officially been put on the back burner until further notice.

I have decided to devote my limited free time to learning web development for the next few months.

We shall see how that goes.
