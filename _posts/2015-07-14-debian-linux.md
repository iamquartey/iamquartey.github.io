I have been a Windows user for most of my computing life and cannot wait to get my reserved download/license of Windows 10.

I own a Mac and enjoy Mac OS X, but haven't used a Mac as my daily computing device for more than about two months.  I have tried [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) for a few hours in a VM and enjoyed it enough to read a bit of history about it.  Soon after learning that Ubuntu is based on Debian I became interested in trying out the [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) distribution of GNU/Linux.

Ultimately, I would like to become more proficient with the terminal and to rely less on GUI's for handling some of my computing needs.  This mindset does not just apply to one system I can learn Powershell for Windows use and bash shell for Mac OS and GNU/Linux.
