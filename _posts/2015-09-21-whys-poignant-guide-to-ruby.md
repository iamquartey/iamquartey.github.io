If you ever want to read a programming book featuring lots of whimsical examples, stories, characters including cartoon foxes this is the book for you.

 Written and illustrated by formerly mysterious \_why the lucky stiff or \_why for short the book takes you on an adventure while teaching you the basics of the Ruby programming language in a roundabout way.  I have not finished "wPGtr" yet, but I find the illustrations and writing style entertaining.

 While I would not recommend this book to everyone, if you enjoy quirky stories and you are bored with standard technical programming books give it a try.
