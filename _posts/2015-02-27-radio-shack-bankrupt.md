Radio Shack was one of my favorite stores in the 1990's thru early 2000's.

At some point they shifted in an attempt to stay relevant with what seemed like a large focus on cell phone sales and less on the large assortment of electrical components they used to carry in stores. I won't kid myself into thinking I could have done a better job trying to keep Radio Shack profitable, but it's no fun to see so many stores close.  We will see what the company becomes as they transition into the coming changes.
